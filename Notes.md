Based on your provided database schema, here are my recommendations regarding the inclusion of created_at or updated_at fields:

bk_users: It might be useful to include created_at to track when user records are created, especially for auditing purposes.

bk_tokens: You might consider including created_at to track when token records are created, especially if you need to audit token generation.

bk_role: Since roles are not likely to change frequently, including created_at might not be necessary unless you have specific auditing requirements.

bk_restaurants: You might consider including created_at to track when restaurant records are created.

bk_transactions: It might be useful to include both created_at and updated_at fields in this table to track transaction creation and modification times.

bk_investors: Similar to bk_users, it might be useful to include created_at to track investor record creation times.

bk_address: Including created_at might be useful to track when addresses are added to the system.

bk_password_reset: It might be useful to include created_at to track when password reset requests are made.

Remember, the decision to include created_at or updated_at fields depends on your application's specific requirements and whether you need to track the creation or modification times of records in each table for auditing, analysis, or other purposes.
